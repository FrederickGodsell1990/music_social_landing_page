        <h1>🎶 Setlist Social</h1>
        <p>Meet music fans before the show. Grab a drink, talk music, build your own community and make friends who are
            into the same bands, DJs, artists, and performers</p>

        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🎟️ RSVP to a music event via the app</li>
            <li>💬 Get excited together - participate in an online chat with likeminded fans</li>
            <li>🍻 Choose a meetup location - a bar, cafe, or restaurant nearby to the event venue</li>
            <li>🎉 Enjoy the show and build new relationships</li>
        </ul>
